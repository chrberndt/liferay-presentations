# Scrum Definition

> In a nutshell, Scrum requires a *Scrum Master* to foster an environment where:
> 1. A *Product Owner* orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
> 1. The *Scrum Team* turns a selection of the work into an *Increment of value* during a *Sprint*.
> 1. The *Scrum Team* and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
> 1. *Repeat*
