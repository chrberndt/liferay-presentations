* Hello everyone! Thanks for the opportunity to introduce you to Liferay Objects, one of the coolest new features of the Liferay platform.

* Before we start with the presentation, I would suggest to have a quick round of introductions, two or three sentences about your previous experience with Liferay, your role in the procurement/application process, and your expectations for today's presentation.

* To start with myself: my name is Christian Berndt. I have been working with Liferay for more than twelve years now, first as a lead developer for a small Swiss software company and the last five years as a trainer and senior consultant for Liferay itself.

* As for the flow of the event: feel free to ask questions directly during the presentation. Otherwise, I have provided time for discussion and questions at the end of the presentation.
