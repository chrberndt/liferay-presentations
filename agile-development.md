# Testing Methodology

## Introduction

* Testing is an essential phase of any development methodology / project.

# Testing Methodology

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

* Frequently used in both extreme programming (XP) and Scrum
* Unit tests are created before the code itself is written
* When the tests pass, that code is considered complete
